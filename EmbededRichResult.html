    <p> Here's an example in JSON-LD to support that breadcrumb that is embeded:</p>
    <script type="application/ld+json">
        {
          "@context": "https://schema.org",
          "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
          "itemListElement": [{
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": 1,
            "name": "Books",
            "item": "https://example.com/books"
          },{
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": 2,
            "name": "Science Fiction",
            "item": "https://example.com/books/sciencefiction"
          },{
            "@type": "ListItem",
            "position": 3,
            "name": "Award Winners"
          }]
